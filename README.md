# Weight Lifting Exercise Prediction
## Practical Machine Learning Course Project
This project will explore the Weight Lifting Excercises dataset. Six subjects participated 
in a dumbell lifting excercise in five different ways (identified as classe A, B, C, D, E),
and data are gathered from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell. You can 
download it and learn more from [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

The goal is by applying machine learning algorithms to these data to predict the manner 
of exercise, and estimate the out-of-sample errors. The result of this analysis confirms 
that random forest prediction achieves a higher accuracy than other three algorithms.
